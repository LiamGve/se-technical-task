# Secret Escapes Full stack engineer take home task

This project is a starting point for the fullstack engineer technical interview take home task.
It consists of a Frontend (with some functionality already build) and a backend application (to be created by you).

## Frontend application

The frontend application is build using Create react app and is a simple react app using typescript.

### Prerequisites

- Node (version 14+)
- Yarn (modern version)

### To install dependencies

From the `frontend-application` directory and `yarn`

### To start the application

From the `frontend-application` directory run `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Project overview

- `.env` contains URL for Sparrow graphql API
- `index.tsx` is where the application is set up, including the configuration of Apollo client
- `App.tsx` is the root of the application, and where URL routing is configured
- `UserContext` is set up in `App`, this means you can access the user ID in any component via this context
- `FavouritesContext` is set up in `App`, this context provides dummy functionality for holding the state of the favourites for a given user, this data will be lost when reloading a page, or logging in cross browser, and should be replaced with calls to an API.
- `pages` directory contains the top-level components which form the contents of each page
- `components` directory contains other reusable components
- `layout` contains the main layout for the page including menu bar
- `utils` contains helper functions to perform data fetching
